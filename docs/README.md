# 🤖 Technical Interview AI - Complete Training System

Train your own AI technical interviewer that can conduct programming interviews across multiple languages and experience levels!

## 🎯 What This System Does

This system trains an AI that can:

- ✅ Conduct technical interviews for **6 programming languages** (Python, Java, C#, Flutter, PHP, JavaScript)
- ✅ Adapt questions for **4 experience levels** (Junior, Mid-level, Senior, Lead)
- ✅ Generate **context-aware follow-up questions** based on candidate responses
- ✅ Maintain **natural conversation flow** throughout interviews
- ✅ **Assess candidate knowledge** and adjust difficulty accordingly

## 🚀 Quick Start on Google Colab Pro

### Option 1: One-Command Training (Recommended)

1. **Open Google Colab Pro**
2. **Upload all files** to your Colab environment
3. **Run the training pipeline:**

```bash
python colab_training_pipeline.py --num_scenarios 150 --epochs 3
```

That's it! Your AI will be trained and ready in 30-60 minutes.

### Option 2: Step-by-Step Notebook

1. **Open `COLAB_SETUP.ipynb`** in Google Colab
2. **Follow the guided cells** for a detailed walkthrough
3. **Customize training parameters** as needed

## ⚙️ Training Configuration

### Default Settings (Optimized for Colab Pro)

```python
TRAINING_CONFIG = {
    'num_scenarios': 150,        # Interview scenarios to generate
    'epochs': 3,                 # Training epochs
    'batch_size': 1,             # Memory-optimized batch size
    'learning_rate': 2e-5,       # Conservative learning rate
    'max_length': 256,           # Sequence length
    'base_model': 'microsoft/DialoGPT-small'  # Colab-friendly model
}
```

### Memory Requirements

- **Minimum:** 8GB GPU memory (T4)
- **Recommended:** 16GB GPU memory (V100/A100)
- **Training Time:** 30-60 minutes

## 🎮 Using Your Trained Model

### Simple Usage

```python
from technical_interview_bot import TechnicalInterviewBot

# Initialize your trained AI
bot = TechnicalInterviewBot('./technical_interview_model')

# Start an interview
response = bot.start_interview(
    programming_language='python',
    experience_level='mid_level',
    candidate_name='John Doe'
)
print(response)

# Process candidate responses
follow_up = bot.process_response("Lists are mutable, tuples are immutable")
print(follow_up)
```

### Interactive Demo

After training, run the included demo:

```bash
python technical_interview_model/demo.py
```

## 🛠️ Customization Options

### Add More Programming Languages

1. Edit `technical_questions_db.py`
2. Add new language enum and questions
3. Retrain with more scenarios

### Adjust for Your Company

1. Modify questions to match your tech stack
2. Add company-specific scenarios
3. Customize experience level criteria

### Different Interview Types

- System design interviews
- Behavioral questions
- Code review sessions
- Architecture discussions

## 🧠 AI Capabilities

### Adaptive Questioning

- **Smart Follow-ups:** Generates relevant follow-up questions
- **Difficulty Adjustment:** Adapts based on candidate performance
- **Context Awareness:** Remembers conversation history

### Multi-Language Support

| Language   | Experience Levels | Question Types                         |
| ---------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Python     | Junior → Lead     | Fundamentals, OOP, Frameworks          |
| Java       | Junior → Lead     | Spring, Concurrency, Design Patterns   |
| C#         | Junior → Lead     | .NET, Async/Await, Architecture        |
| Flutter    | Junior → Lead     | Widgets, State Management, Performance |
| PHP        | Junior → Lead     | PSR Standards, Security, Modern PHP    |
| JavaScript | Junior → Lead     | ES6+, Closures, Async Programming      |

### Response Assessment

- **Quality Scoring:** 1-5 scale based on technical depth
- **Performance Tracking:** Monitors candidate strengths/weaknesses
- **Interview Summaries:** Detailed reports for hiring teams

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. GPU Out of Memory**

```bash
# Reduce batch size and scenarios
python colab_training_pipeline.py --num_scenarios 50 --batch_size 1
```

**2. Training Too Slow**

```bash
# Use fewer scenarios for faster training
python colab_training_pipeline.py --num_scenarios 75 --epochs 2
```

**3. Model Quality Issues**

```bash
# Increase training data and epochs
python colab_training_pipeline.py --num_scenarios 200 --epochs 5
```

### Memory Optimization Tips

- Use `batch_size=1` for limited GPU memory
- Reduce `max_length` to 128 for faster training
- Enable `fp16=True` for mixed precision training
- Clear GPU cache between training runs

## 📊 Expected Results
